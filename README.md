## 💾 How to play?
If you would like to play this game, download the .zip of this repository and run the executable. Have fun! (QB64 compiles to Windows only, unfortunately. Sorry, Mac users)

## ❓ ¿Que?
This is not really a game but it was a fun, lil program that I made a pretty long time ago. All you do is rapidly tap your space bar or tap it to the beat of a song and an ascii stick figure begins to break it down on the dance floor of your mind, randomly laying down what's good all over the place. Lol have fun with it or whateva. Personally, I kept it on my desktop and opened it whenever I felt like taking a mental break and wanted to listen to some music. Its pretty neat if you're the type of person who doesn't take much to become amused, like me.
