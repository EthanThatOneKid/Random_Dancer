## About ❓

This program was created with the [QB64 IDE][qb64_home] ([code][qb64_gh]) in a modern superset of the BASIC programming language.

**Developer's Note**:

> This is not really a game but it was a fun, little program that I made a pretty long time ago. All you do is rapidly tap your space bar or tap it to the beat of a song and an ASCII stick figure begins to break it down on the dance floor. Personally, I kept it on my desktop and opened it whenever I felt like taking a mental break and listen to some music. It is pretty neat if you're a type of person with simple pleasures, like me.
